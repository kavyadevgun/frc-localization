Welcome! The purpose of this repository is to provide easy access to information about our FRC localization system project. Our project aims to locate First Robotics Competition (FRC) robots in the competition field. We created this system according to the following design requirements:

*The localization system must be an off-the-shelf product that is:*
1. *Less than $400*
2. *Compatible with the FRC control system that is used by each team*
3. *Accurate within one foot, but preferably within one inch*
4. *The system is programmable in Java, C++, or LabVIEW*

Our system consists of three main parts: one that determines the initial position of the robot, another that finds the instantaneous position of the robot throughout the competition, and a third that displays the position and orientation of the robot in a user-friendly manner.

We tackled this project by splitting our group into two teams -- the first team investigated the use of HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors to determine the initial position of the robot relative to the objects in and around the field, and the second team investigated the use of encoder technology used in conjunction with a navX sensor to report the robot's instantaneous position throughout the course of the competition. Please check out the other pages in this repository for more specifics about each project.
