Finding the initial position is key to minimize error throughout the competition. 

**how do distance sensors work**

**what is the set up of the system**

During the competition preparation season, students will be able to point our sensor set up at a solid surface and save their desired distances -- up to four "presets" -- in the Arduino computer that is wired inside of the system. During the actual competition, the students will be able to cycle through their saved presets so that the distance 

The distance from the walls will be displayed on an LCD screen and sent to the Robot’s system. A multi color LED will change color (on a scale of a red light meaning that the robot is far from the ideal position, a yellow light indicating that the robot is partially close, and a green light indicating that the robot is in range) as an indicator of how close the user is to the desired starting position. This desired starting position can be input by the user depending on the field layout.

These sensors can be used again throughout the competition to “check” and recalibrate the position of the robot as needed by the user.
