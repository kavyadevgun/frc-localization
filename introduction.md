Welcome! The purpose of this website is to provide easy access to information about our FRC localization system. We created a system according to the following design requirements:

*The localization system must be an off-the-shelf product that is:*
1. *Less than $400*
2. *Compatible with the FRC control system that is used by each team*
3. *Accurate within one foot, but preferably within one inch*
4. *The system is programmable in Java, C++, or LabVIEW*

We tackled this problem by splitting our group into two teams -- one team investigated the use of HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors to determine the initial position of the robot, and the other team investigated the use of encoder technology used in conjunction with a navEx sensor to report the robot's instantaneous position throughout the course of the competition.
